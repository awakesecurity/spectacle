-- | Defining and handling higher-order effects in the 'Effect' data family.
--
-- === Example usage of the Effect family
--
-- The ask operation for the Reader effect is given by GADT:
--
-- @
-- data Reader r :: 'EffectK' where
--   Ask :: Reader r r
-- @
--
-- 'EffectK' intentionally precludes the ability for accessing the 'Language.Spectacle.Lang.Lang' in
-- its continuation which is needed to define a "local" operation for Reader. If this was allowed,
-- it becomes very easy for effects to escape the scope of the free monad and continue without being
-- handled, examples of which are in [1. Effect Handlers in Haskell, Evidently.]("Language.Spectacle.Lang.Scoped#references").
-- Instead, scoped operations like local are defined in a corresponding instance of 'Effect'
-- like so:
--
-- @
-- data instance 'Effect' (Reader r) m a where
--   Local :: m a -> (r -> r) -> 'Effect' (Reader r) m a
-- @
--
-- Where @m@ is some 'Langauge.Spectacle.Lang.Lang'. This approach lets us define scoped operations
-- which may have:
--
-- * Dependencies on other effects.
-- * Constraints on types in the effect.
-- * Monomorphic types in the continuation.
--
-- Effects which only have first-order operations must still give a newtype instance for 'Effect'
-- wrapping 'Data.Void.Void' and handled with 'Data.Void.absurd'.
--
-- === Reasoning behind the 'Effect' family
--
-- The typical approach to handling higher-order effects is done by "weaving" which is described in
-- [2. Effect Handler in Scope]("Language.Spectacle.Lang.Scoped#references"). It requires that every
-- effect have an instance of @(forall x. f (m x) -> n (f x))@. This forces all effects to be
-- polymorphic in their continuation due to the rigidity of @x@. Effects like the quantifier syntax
-- can't be defined this way since there is no way to weave @(a -> m Bool)@.
--
-- An alternative would be to change the continuation of the Freer monad to accumulate weaves rather
-- than monadic actions, thus pushing the weaving responsibility to the handler site. This allows
-- monomorphic effects and constrained data contexts, but struggles with handling effects like NonDet
-- since it's not possible to distribute functors over the freer monad. The way to work around this is
-- to use a concrete functorial state like ListT to distribute and then fold back into the resulting
-- alternative. This works at the consequence of having different semantics for NonDet in first-
-- order vs higher-order operations.
--
-- The 'Effect' family solves boths problems since:
--
-- 1. Weaving 'Effect' instances is done in the handler for the effect.
--
-- 2. An 'Effect' instance is a seperate case from its corresponding first-order effect so effects
-- like NonDet can weave in terms of its own interpreter rather than choosing a concrete functor as
-- an intermediate carrier.
